#DAY 5 Exercise 1

# Average Height

#Instructions

'''
You are going to write a program that calculates the average student height from a List of heights.

e.g. student_heights = [180, 124, 165, 173, 189, 169, 146]

The average height can be calculated by adding all the heights together and dividing by the total number of heights.

e.g.

180 + 124 + 165 + 173 + 189 + 169 + 146 = 1146

There are a total of 7 heights in student_heights

1146 ÷ 7 = 163.71428571428572

Average height rounded to the nearest whole number = 164

Important You should not use the sum() or len() functions in your answer. You should try to replicate their functionality using what you have learnt about for loops.

Hint:
Remember to use the round() function to round the average height before you print it.

#CODE

# 🚨 Don't change the code below 👇
student_heights = input("Input a list of student heights ").split()
for n in range(0, len(student_heights)):
  student_heights[n] = int(student_heights[n])
# 🚨 Don't change the code above 👆


#Write your code below this row 👇

total_height = 0
for h in student_heights:
  total_height = total_height + h
#print(total_height)

number_of_students = 0
for n in student_heights:
  number_of_students = number_of_students + 1
#print(number_of_students)

average_height = round(total_height/number_of_students)
print(average_height)
